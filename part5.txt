PART 5: RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Zi Mo Su 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Four different training sets were used for training the alignment model
with IBM 1. The training sets consisted of 1000, 10k, 15k and 30k sentences
each. 

A cap of 2 was set in the BLEU calculation.

A delta value of 0.5 was used for smoothing.

The initialization of the probabilities (align_ibm1 subfunction initialize)
was done such that the initial probabilities for the example below are:

    example sentences:
        ENGLISH:    'A B C'
                    'A B'
        FRENCH:     'X Y Z'
                    'X Y'

    the probabilities would be:
        AM.A.X = 0.4
        AM.A.Y = 0.4
        AM.A.Z = 0.2

This leads to a better prediction than if it was initialized with 0.33 for
each of the above.

We observe that for a smaller training set the performance based on BLEU is
worse than for larger sets. This makes sense because having less words to
train with results in missing words in our translation. 

A lot of the BLEU scores are the same for sets 10k, 15k and 30k sentences 
in length. This makes sense because the training set will experience a 
smaller change as it grows since the vocabulary of the set is capped; in 
other words, training with 1000 sentences results in n words seen. Then 
training with 10k will result in n+e words seen where e < n. As we grow 
even more to 15k or 30k, we will see n+e+f words where f << n. So the
growth in words seen is decreasing.

We see that in terms of BLEU scores, some of the test sentences will have 0
for n=3. This is not surprising as it is much harder to get trigrams,
especially if the sentence is short.

To improve our results, we can train on a larger set of sentences. This may
result in overfitting, but since our training and test set are from the
same dataset, it will be less of a problem. We could also evaluate our
performance with more references. This will return better results in
general, and no change at the minimum because we will retain the original
two references.

Since our data is from Hansard, there may be regularities that are present
in Hansard only which would entail a good translation if the desired output
is of Hansard 'style' but perhaps a poorer translation if the desired
output is more general.
